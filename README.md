# event_manager

This is a tutorial I (mostly) followed along with given in The Odin Project in which I began to learn to interact with APIs, parse CSV files, utilize ERB, and more. Was good practice for file handling. 

Towards the end, I was tasked with creating 3 new methods (cleaning phone numbers, returning the most popular registration hours, and returning the most popular registration days) to add further functionality to the program.
